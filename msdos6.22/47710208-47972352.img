   In the class example described above all the methods have the normal
modifier.  This method modifier information is located just after the
protection information for the method.  This field has four possible
character values.  Normal methods use `A', const methods use `B',
volatile methods use `C', and const volatile methods use `D'.  Consider
the class definition below:

     class A {
     public:
             int ConstMeth (int arg) const { return arg; };
             char VolatileMeth (char arg) volatile { return arg; };
             float ConstVolMeth (float arg) const volatile {return arg; };
     };

   This class is described by the following stab:

     .stabs "class(A):sym_desc(struct)type_def(20)=type_desc(struct)struct_bytes(1)
             meth_name(ConstMeth)::type_def(21)sym_desc(method)
             returning(int);:arg(int);protection(public)modifier(const)virtual(no);
             meth_name(VolatileMeth)::type_def(22)=sym_desc(method)

             meth_name(ConstVolMeth)::type_def(23)=sym_desc(method)
             returning(float);:arg(float);protection(public)modifier(const volatile)
             virtual(no);;", ...

8.11 Virtual Methods
====================

<< The following examples are based on a4.C >>

   The presence of virtual methods in a class definition adds additional
data to the class description.  The extra data is appended to the
description of the virtual method and to the end of the class
description.  Consider the class definition below:

     class A {
     public:
             int Adat;
             virtual int A_virt (int arg) { return arg; };
     };

   This results in the stab below describing class A.  It defines a new
type (20) which is an 8 byte structure.  The first field of the class
struct is `Adat', an integer, starting at structure offset 0 and
occupying 32 bits.

   The second field in the class struct is not explicitly defined by the
C++ class definition but is implied by the fact that the class contains
a virtual method.  This field is the vtable pointer.  The name of the
vtable pointer field starts with `$vf' and continues with a type
reference to the class it is part of.  In this example the type
reference for class A is 20 so the name of its vtable pointer field is
`$vf20', followed by the usual colon.

   Next there is a type definition for the vtable pointer type (21).
This is in turn defined as a pointer to another new type (22).

   Type 22 is the vtable itself, which is defined as an array, indexed
by a range of integers between 0 and 1, and whose elements are of type
17.  Type 17 was the vtable record type defined by the boilerplate C++
type definitions, as shown earlier.

   The bit offset of the vtable pointer field is 32.  The number of bits
in the field are not specified when the field is a vtable pointer.

   Next is the method definition for the virtual member function
`A_virt'.  Its description starts out using the same format as the
non-virtual member functions described above, except instead of a dot
after the `A' there is an asterisk, indicating that the function is
virtual.  Since is is virtual some addition information is appended to
the end of the method description.

   The first number represents the vtable index of the method.  This is
a 32 bit unsigned number with the high bit set, followed by a
semi-colon.

   The second number is a type reference to the first base class in the
inheritance hierarchy defining the virtual member function.  In this
case the class stab describes a base class so the virtual function is
not overriding any other definition of the method.  Therefore the
reference is to the type number of the class that the stab is
describing (20).

   This is followed by three semi-colons.  One marks the end of the
current sub-section, one marks the end of the method field, and the
third marks the end of the struct definition.

   For classes containing virtual functions the very last section of the
string part of the stab holds a type reference to the first base class.
This is preceded by `~%' and followed by a final semi-colon.

     .stabs "class_name(A):type_def(20)=sym_desc(struct)struct_bytes(8)
             field_name(Adat):type_ref(int),bit_offset(0),field_bits(32);
             field_name(A virt func ptr):type_def(21)=type_desc(ptr to)type_def(22)=
             sym_desc(array)index_type_ref(range of int from 0 to 1);
             elem_type_ref(vtbl elem type),
             bit_offset(32);
             meth_name(A_virt)::typedef(23)=sym_desc(method)returning(int);
             :arg_type(int),protection(public)normal(yes)virtual(yes)
             vtable_index(1);class_first_defining(A);;;~%first_base(A);",
             N_LSYM,NIL,NIL,NIL

     .stabs "A:t20=s8Adat:1,0,32;$vf20:21=*22=ar1;0;1;17,32;

8.12 Inheritance
================

Stabs describing C++ derived classes include additional sections that
describe the inheritance hierarchy of the class.  A derived class stab
also encodes the number of base classes.  For each base class it tells
if the base class is virtual or not, and if the inheritance is private
or public.  It also gives the offset into the object of the portion of
the object corresponding to each base class.

   This additional information is embedded in the class stab following
the number of bytes in the struct.  First the number of base classes
appears bracketed by an exclamation point and a comma.

   Then for each base type there repeats a series: a virtual character,
a visibility character, a number, a comma, another number, and a
semi-colon.

   The virtual character is `1' if the base class is virtual and `0' if
not.  The visibility character is `2' if the derivation is public, `1'
if it is protected, and `0' if it is private.  Debuggers should ignore
virtual or visibility characters they do not recognize, and assume a
reasonable default (such as public and non-virtual) (GDB 4.11 does not,
but this should be fixed in the next GDB release).

   The number following the virtual and visibility characters is the
offset from the start of the object to the part of the object
pertaining to the base class.

   After the comma, the second number is a type_descriptor for the base
type.  Finally a semi-colon ends the series, which repeats for each
base class.

   The source below defines three base classes `A', `B', and `C' and
the derived class `D'.

     class A {
     public:
             int Adat;
             virtual int A_virt (int arg) { return arg; };
     };

     class B {
     public:
             int B_dat;
             virtual int B_virt (int arg) {return arg; };
     };

     class C {
     public:
             int Cdat;
             virtual int C_virt (int arg) {return arg; };
     };

     class D : A, virtual B, public C {
     public:
             int Ddat;
             virtual int A_virt (int arg ) { return arg+1; };
             virtual int B_virt (int arg)  { return arg+2; };
             virtual int C_virt (int arg)  { return arg+3; };
             virtual int D_virt (int arg)  { return arg; };
     };

   Class stabs similar to the ones described earlier are generated for
each base class.

     .stabs "A:T20=s8Adat:1,0,32;$vf20:21=*22=ar1;0;1;17,32;
             A_virt::23=##1;:i;2A*-2147483647;20;;;~%20;",128,0,0,0

the derivation of this class is encoded as follows.

8.13 Virtual Base Classes
=========================

A derived class object consists of a concatenation in memory of the data
areas defined by each base class, starting with the leftmost and ending
with the rightmost in the list of base classes.  The exception to this
rule is for virtual inheritance.  In the example above, class `D'
inherits virtually from base class `B'.  This means that an instance of
a `D' object will not contain its own `B' part but merely a pointer to
a `B' part, known as a virtual base pointer.

   In a derived class stab, the base offset part of the derivation
information, described above, shows how the base class parts are
ordered.  The base offset for a virtual base class is always given as 0.
Notice that the base offset for `B' is given as 0 even though `B' is
not the first base class.  The first base class `A' starts at offset 0.

   The field information part of the stab for class `D' describes the
field which is the pointer to the virtual base class `B'. The vbase
pointer name is `$vb' followed by a type reference to the virtual base
class.  Since the type id for `B' in this example is 25, the vbase
pointer name is `$vb25'.

     .stabs "D:Tt31=s32!3,000,20;100,25;0264,28;$vb25:24,128;Ddat:1,
            160,32;A_virt::32=##1;:i;2A*-2147483647;20;;B_virt::32:i;
            2A*-2147483647;25;;C_virt::32:i;2A*-2147483647;28;;D_virt:
            :32:i;2A*-2147483646;31;;;~%20;",128,0,0,0

   Following the name and a semicolon is a type reference describing the
type of the virtual base class pointer, in this case 24.  Type 24 was
defined earlier as the type of the `B' class `this' pointer.  The
`this' pointer for a class is a pointer to the class type.

     .stabs "this:P24=*25=xsB:",64,0,0,8

   Finally the field offset part of the vbase pointer field description
shows that the vbase pointer is the first field in the `D' object,
before any data fields defined by the class.  The layout of a `D' class
object is a follows, `Adat' at 0, the vtable pointer for `A' at 32,
`Cdat' at 64, the vtable pointer for C at 96, the virtual base pointer
for `B' at 128, and `Ddat' at 160.

8.14 Static Members
===================

The data area for a class is a concatenation of the space used by the
data members of the class.  If the class has virtual methods, a vtable
pointer follows the class data.  The field offset part of each field
description in the class stab shows this ordering.

Appendix E Questions and Anomalies
**********************************

   * For GNU C stabs defining local and global variables (`N_LSYM' and
     `N_GSYM'), the desc field is supposed to contain the source line
     number on which the variable is defined.  In reality the desc
     field is always 0.  (This behavior is defined in `dbxout.c' and
     putting a line number in desc is controlled by `#ifdef
     WINNING_GDB', which defaults to false). GDB supposedly uses this
     information if you say `list VAR'.  In reality, VAR can be a
     variable defined in the program and GDB says `function VAR not
     defined'.

   * In GNU C stabs, there seems to be no way to differentiate tag
     types: structures, unions, and enums (symbol descriptor `T') and
     typedefs (symbol descriptor `t') defined at file scope from types
     defined locally to a procedure or other more local scope.  They
     all use the `N_LSYM' stab type.  Types defined at procedure scope
     are emitted after the `N_RBRAC' of the preceding function and
     before the code of the procedure in which they are defined.  This
     is exactly the same as types defined in the source file between
     the two procedure bodies.  GDB over-compensates by placing all
     types in block #1, the block for symbols of file scope.  This is
     true for default, `-ansi' and `-traditional' compiler options.
     (Bugs gcc/1063, gdb/1066.)

   * What ends the procedure scope?  Is it the proc block's `N_RBRAC'
     or the next `N_FUN'?  (I believe its the first.)

Appendix F Using Stabs in Their Own Sections
********************************************

Many object file formats allow tools to create object files with custom
sections containing any arbitrary data.  For any such object file
format, stabs can be embedded in special sections.  This is how stabs
are used with ELF and SOM, and aside from ECOFF and XCOFF, is how stabs
are used with COFF.

* Menu:

* Stab Section Basics::    How to embed stabs in sections
* ELF Linker Relocation::  Sun ELF hacks


File: stabs.info,  Node: Stab Section Basics,  Next: ELF Linker Relocation,  Up: Stab Sections

F.1 How to Embed Stabs in Sections
==================================

The assembler creates two custom sections, a section named `.stab'
which contains an array of fixed length structures, one struct per stab,
and a section named `.stabstr' containing all the variable length
strings that are referenced by stabs in the `.stab' section.  The byte
order of the stabs binary data depends on the object file format.  For
ELF, it matches the byte order of the ELF file itself, as determined
from the `EI_DATA' field in the `e_ident' member of the ELF header.
For SOM, it is always big-endian (is this true??? FIXME).  For COFF, it
matches the byte order of the COFF headers.  The meaning of the fields
is the same as for a.out (*note Symbol Table Format::), except that the
`n_strx' field is relative to the strings for the current compilation
unit (which can be found using the synthetic N_UNDF stab described
below), rather than the entire string table.

   The first stab in the `.stab' section for each compilation unit is
synthetic, generated entirely by the assembler, with no corresponding
`.stab' directive as input to the assembler.  This stab contains the
following fields:

`n_strx'
     Offset in the `.stabstr' section to the source filename.

`n_type'
     `N_UNDF'.

`n_other'
     Unused field, always zero.  This may eventually be used to hold
     overflows from the count in the `n_desc' field.

`n_desc'
     Count of upcoming symbols, i.e., the number of remaining stabs for
     this source file.

`n_value'
     Size of the string table fragment associated with this source
     file, in bytes.

   The `.stabstr' section always starts with a null byte (so that string
offsets of zero reference a null string), followed by random length
strings, each of which is null byte terminated.

   The ELF section header for the `.stab' section has its `sh_link'
member set to the section number of the `.stabstr' section, and the
`.stabstr' section has its ELF section header `sh_type' member set to
`SHT_STRTAB' to mark it as a string table.  SOM and COFF have no way of
linking the sections together or marking them as string tables.

   For COFF, the `.stab' and `.stabstr' sections may be simply
concatenated by the linker.  GDB then uses the `n_desc' fields to
figure out the extent of the original sections.  Similarly, the
`n_value' fields of the header symbols are added together in order to
get the actual position of the strings in a desired `.stabstr' section.
Although this design obviates any need for the linker to relocate or
otherwise manipulate `.stab' and `.stabstr' sections, it also requires
some care to ensure that the offsets are calculated correctly.  For
instance, if the linker were to pad in between the `.stabstr' sections
before concatenating, then the offsets to strings in the middle of the
executable's `.stabstr' section would be wrong.

   The GNU linker is able to optimize stabs information by merging
duplicate strings and removing duplicate header file information (*note
Include Files::).  When some versions of the GNU linker optimize stabs
in sections, they remove the leading `N_UNDF' symbol and arranges for
all the `n_strx' fields to be relative to the start of the `.stabstr'
section.

F.2 Having the Linker Relocate Stabs in ELF
===========================================

This section describes some Sun hacks for Stabs in ELF; it does not
apply to COFF or SOM.

   To keep linking fast, you don't want the linker to have to relocate
very many stabs.  Making sure this is done for `N_SLINE', `N_RBRAC',
and `N_LBRAC' stabs is the most important thing (see the descriptions
of those stabs for more information).  But Sun's stabs in ELF has taken
this further, to make all addresses in the `n_value' field (functions
and static variables) relative to the source file.  For the `N_SO'
symbol itself, Sun simply omits the address.  To find the address of
each section corresponding to a given source file, the compiler puts
out symbols giving the address of each section for a given source file.
Since these are ELF (not stab) symbols, the linker relocates them
correctly without having to touch the stabs section.  They are named
`Bbss.bss' for the bss section, `Ddata.data' for the data section, and
`Drodata.rodata' for the rodata section.  For the text section, there
is no such symbol (but there should be, see below).  For an example of
how these symbols work, *Note Stab Section Transformations::.  GCC does
not provide these symbols; it instead relies on the stabs getting
relocated.  Thus addresses which would normally be relative to
`Bbss.bss', etc., are already relocated.  The Sun linker provided with
Solaris 2.2 and earlier relocates stabs using normal ELF relocation
information, as it would do for any section.  Sun has been threatening
to kludge their linker to not do this (to speed up linking), even
though the correct way to avoid having the linker do these relocations
is to have the compiler no longer output relocatable values.  Last I
heard they had been talked out of the linker kludge.  See Sun point
patch 101052-01 and Sun bug 1142109.  With the Sun compiler this
affects `S' symbol descriptor stabs (*note Statics::) and functions
(*note Procedures::).  In the latter case, to adopt the clean solution
(making the value of the stab relative to the start of the compilation
unit), it would be necessary to invent a `Ttext.text' symbol, analogous
to the `Bbss.bss', etc., symbols.  I recommend this rather than using a
zero value and getting the address from the ELF symbols.

   Finding the correct `Bbss.bss', etc., symbol is difficult, because
the linker simply concatenates the `.stab' sections from each `.o' file
without including any information about which part of a `.stab' section
comes from which `.o' file.  The way GDB does this is to look for an
ELF `STT_FILE' symbol which has the same name as the last component of
the file name from the `N_SO' symbol in the stabs (for example, if the
file name is `../../gdb/main.c', it looks for an ELF `STT_FILE' symbol
named `main.c').  This loses if different files have the same name
(they could be in different directories, a library could have been
copied from one system to another, etc.).  It would be much cleaner to
have the `Bbss.bss' symbols in the stabs themselves.  Having the linker
relocate them there is no more work than having the linker relocate ELF
symbols, and it solves the problem of having to associate the ELF and
stab symbols.  However, no one has yet designed or implemented such a
scheme.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.

       The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow  you  to
       see  what  is going on ``inside'' another program while it
       executes--or what another program was doing at the  moment
       it crashed.

       GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in
       support of these) to help you catch bugs in the act:


          +o   Start your program, specifying anything that  might
              affect its behavior.


          +o   Make your program stop on specified conditions.


          +o   Examine  what  has  happened, when your program has
              stopped.


          +o   Change things in your program, so you  can  experi-
              ment  with correcting the effects of one bug and go
              on to learn about another.


       You can use GDB to debug programs written in C,  C++,  and
       Modula-2.   Fortran  support will be added when a GNU For-
       tran compiler is ready.

       GDB is invoked with the shell command ggddbb.  Once  started,
       it  reads  commands from the terminal until you tell it to
       exit with the GDB command qquuiitt.  You can get  online  help
       from ggddbb itself by using the command hheellpp.

       You can run ggddbb with no arguments or options; but the most
       usual way to start GDB is with one argument or two, speci-
       fying an executable program as the argument:

       gdb program


       You  can  also start with both an executable program and a
       core file specified:

       You can, instead, specify a process ID as a  second  argu-
       ment, if you want to debug a running process:

       gdb program 1234


       would  attach  GDB to process 11223344 (unless you also have a
       file named `11223344'; GDB does check for a core file  first).

       Here are some of the most frequently needed GDB commands:

       bbrreeaakk [_f_i_l_e::]_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n
               Set a breakpoint at _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n (in _f_i_l_e).

       rruunn [_a_r_g_l_i_s_t]
              Start your program (with _a_r_g_l_i_s_t, if specified).

       bbtt     Backtrace: display the program stack.

       pprriinntt _e_x_p_r
               Display the value of an expression.

       cc      Continue running your program (after stopping, e.g.
              at a breakpoint).

       nneexxtt   Execute next program line  (after  stopping);  step
              _o_v_e_r any function calls in the line.

       eeddiitt [_f_i_l_e::]_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n
              look  at  the  program  line  where it is presently
              stopped.

       lliisstt [_f_i_l_e::]_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n
              type the text of the program  in  the  vicinity  of
              where it is presently stopped.

       sstteepp   Execute  next  program  line (after stopping); step
              _i_n_t_o any function calls in the line.

       hheellpp [_n_a_m_e]
              Show information about GDB command _n_a_m_e, or general
              information about using GDB.

       qquuiitt   Exit from GDB.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Any arguments other than  options  specify  an  executable
       file  and  core  file  (or process ID); that is, the first
       argument encountered with no  associated  option  flag  is
       equivalent  to  a `--ssee' option, and the second, if any, is
       equivalent to a `--cc' option if it's the name  of  a  file.
       Many  options  have  both  long  and short forms; both are
       shown here.  The long forms are  also  recognized  if  you
       truncate  them, so long as enough of the option is present
       to be unambiguous.  (If you prefer, you  can  flag  option
       arguments  with  `++' rather than `--', though we illustrate
       the more usual convention.)

       All the options and command line arguments  you  give  are
       processed  in sequential order.  The order makes a differ-
       ence when the `--xx' option is used.


       --hheellpp

       --hh     List all options, with brief explanations.


       --ssyymmbboollss==_f_i_l_e

       --ss _f_i_l_e
               Read symbol table from file _f_i_l_e.


       --wwrriittee Enable writing into executable and core files.


       --eexxeecc==_f_i_l_e

       --ee _f_i_l_e
               Use file _f_i_l_e as the executable  file  to  execute
              when  appropriate,  and  for examining pure data in
              conjunction with a core dump.


       --ssee==_f_i_l_e
               Read symbol table from file _f_i_l_e and use it as the
              executable file.


       --ccoorree==_f_i_l_e

       --cc _f_i_l_e
               Use file _f_i_l_e as a core dump to examine.


       --ccoommmmaanndd==_f_i_l_e

gdb(1)                      GNU Tools                      gdb(1)


       --xx _f_i_l_e
               Execute GDB commands from file _f_i_l_e.


       --eexx _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
               Execute given GDB _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.


       --ddiirreeccttoorryy==_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y

       --dd _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
                Add  _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y  to  the path to search for source
              files.



       --nnxx

       --nn     Do not execute commands from  any  `..ggddbbiinniitt'  ini-
              tialization files.  Normally, the commands in these
              files are executed after all  the  command  options
              and arguments have been processed.



       --qquuiieett

       --qq     ``Quiet''.  Do not print the introductory and copy-
              right messages.  These messages are also suppressed
              in batch mode.


       --bbaattcchh Run  in  batch mode.  Exit with status 00 after pro-
              cessing all the command files specified  with  `--xx'
              (and  `..ggddbbiinniitt',  if  not  inhibited).   Exit with
              nonzero status if an error occurs in executing  the
              GDB commands in the command files.

              Batch  mode may be useful for running GDB as a fil-
              ter, for example to download and run a  program  on
              another  computer;  in order to make this more use-
              ful, the message

              Program exited normally.


              (which is ordinarily issued whenever a program run-
              ning  under  GDB  control terminates) is not issued
              when running in batch mode.


       --ccdd==_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
               Run GDB using _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y as its working  directory,
              instead of the current directory.

       --ffuullllnnaammee

       --ff     Emacs  sets  this option when it runs GDB as a sub-
              process.  It tells GDB to output the full file name
              and line number in a standard, recognizable fashion
              each  time  a  stack  frame  is  displayed   (which
              includes each time the program stops).  This recog-
              nizable format looks  like  two  ` 3322'  characters,
              followed  by the file name, line number and charac-
              ter position separated by colons,  and  a  newline.
              The  Emacs-to-GDB  interface  program  uses the two
              ` 3322' characters as a signal to display the  source
              code for the frame.


       --bb _b_p_s   Set the line speed (baud rate or bits per second)
              of any serial interface  used  by  GDB  for  remote
              debugging.


       --ttttyy==_d_e_v_i_c_e
               Run using _d_e_v_i_c_e for your program's standard input
              and output.
