## About this IDE
Hope you enjoy my version of the 8bitworkshop IDE!

The main changes I have made are to attempt to add more target platforms, and to add more features. Most notable currently are the addition of the Commodore Vic20, the BBC Micro, and C64 BASIC.

### Recent Features
- **Auto-compile toggle** - Toggle automatic compilation on/off for smoother editing experience
- **Manual build control** - Build and run programs on-demand when auto-compile is disabled
- **Visual status indicator** - Clear "Auto-Compile: ON/OFF" caption with color coding
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - Quick access via `Ctrl+Alt+C` (toggle) and `Ctrl+Alt+M` (manual build)

Some elements are removed such as the Github integration, and the open source C64 ROMs were replaced with the original ones.

Retro Game Coders is a community of developers who create games for vintage computers and consoles.

### Use the original if you want stable and working code! 

WARNING: This version of the repo contains small amounts of `AI SLOP` because my coding abilities were not good enough to get Vic 20 working unaided.

## Tool Server (experimental)

This is an experimental feature that relies on a Docker container to provide compiler tools like [llvm-mos](https://github.com/llvm-mos/llvm-mos-sdk).
Right now, you have to run locally and build your own docker container.

```sh
docker build -t 8bitws-server-debian scripts/docker
docker run -p 3009:3009 8bitws-server-debian
echo '{"REMOTE_URL":"http://localhost:3009/build"}' > remote.json
```

Then add "&tool=llvm-mos" to your URL, like
[this](http://localhost:8000/?platform=c64&file=sprite_collision.c&tool=llvm-mos).
You can also rename your C files to have the suffix "-llvm.c".
Right now only the platforms c64, atari8, nes (NROM), and pce are supported.
Not very many of the current examples work with the new toolchain.
