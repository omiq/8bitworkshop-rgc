# VIC-20 I/O Register Fix

## Problem
The 8bitworkshop VIC-20 emulator was not properly handling I/O register access. Specifically:
- Writes to the border color register at `$900F` were not working
- The emulator was treating I/O registers as regular memory instead of routing them to the appropriate hardware components

## Root Cause
The issue was in the memory access implementation. The VIC-20 emulator was using simple `machine_mem_read` and `machine_mem_write` functions that directly accessed memory, but it wasn't handling I/O register access properly.

Looking at the working chips-test VIC-20 emulator, I discovered that I/O registers need to be handled dynamically in the tick function, not through static memory mapping.

## Solution
I modified the `VIC20_WASMMachine` class in `src/machine/vic20.ts` to:

1. **Add I/O register state storage**:
   ```typescript
   private vic_registers: Uint8Array = new Uint8Array(16); // VIC registers at $9000-$900F
   private color_ram: Uint8Array = new Uint8Array(1024);   // Color RAM at $9400-$97FF
   ```

2. **Override memory read/write methods** to intercept I/O access and sync with WASM memory:
   ```typescript
   read(address: number): number {
     address = address & 0xFFFF;
     
     // VIC registers ($9000-$900F)
     if (address >= 0x9000 && address <= 0x900F) {
       // Read from WASM memory to get the current value
       return this.exports.machine_mem_read(this.sys, address);
     }
     
     // Color RAM ($9400-$97FF)
     if (address >= 0x9400 && address <= 0x97FF) {
       // Read from WASM memory to get the current value
       return this.exports.machine_mem_read(this.sys, address);
     }
     
     // Default memory access
     return super.read(address);
   }
   
   write(address: number, value: number): void {
     address = address & 0xFFFF;
     value = value & 0xFF;
     
     // VIC registers ($9000-$900F)
     if (address >= 0x9000 && address <= 0x900F) {
       this.vic_registers[address - 0x9000] = value;
       console.log(`VIC register write: $${hex(address)} = ${hex(value)}`);
       
       // Also write to WASM memory so the emulator can see it
       this.exports.machine_mem_write(this.sys, address, value);
       
       // Force video sync after VIC register changes
       if (this.exports.machine_sync_video) {
         this.exports.machine_sync_video(this.sys);
       }
       return;
     }
     
     // Color RAM ($9400-$97FF)
     if (address >= 0x9400 && address <= 0x97FF) {
       this.color_ram[address - 0x9400] = value;
       
       // Also write to WASM memory so the emulator can see it
       this.exports.machine_mem_write(this.sys, address, value);
       
       // Force video sync after color RAM changes
       if (this.exports.machine_sync_video) {
         this.exports.machine_sync_video(this.sys);
       }
       return;
     }
     
     // Default memory access
     super.write(address, value);
   }
   ```

## Key Improvements
The solution now:
1. **Intercepts I/O register access** at the TypeScript level
2. **Writes to WASM memory** so the emulator can see the changes
3. **Forces video sync** after I/O register changes
4. **Reads from WASM memory** to get current register values

## Testing
I created two test programs to verify the fix:

1. **Simple Test** (`presets/vic20/simple_test.dasm`): Sets border color to white
2. **Color Test** (`presets/vic20/color_test.dasm`): Cycles through different border colors

## How to Test
1. Start the 8bitworkshop development server: `npm start`
2. Navigate to the VIC-20 platform
3. Select either "Simple Test (ASM)" or "Color Test (ASM)"
4. The border color should now change visibly

## Expected Results
- **Before fix**: Border color register reads would return `FF` (uninitialized) and writes would have no effect
- **After fix**: 
  - Border color register reads/writes work correctly
  - Console logs show register writes: `VIC register write: $900F = 01`
  - Border color should change visibly on screen
  - Video sync is forced after I/O register changes

## Files Modified
- `src/machine/vic20.ts` - Added I/O register handling
- `src/platform/vic20.ts` - Added new test program to presets
- `presets/vic20/simple_test.dasm` - Updated test program
- `presets/vic20/color_test.dasm` - New comprehensive test program

## Next Steps
This fix addresses the immediate I/O register issue. For a complete VIC-20 emulator, you might also want to:

1. Implement proper VIA (Versatile Interface Adapter) handling
2. Add keyboard matrix emulation
3. Implement proper video timing and display
4. Add sound support

The working chips-test VIC-20 emulator provides a good reference for these additional features.
